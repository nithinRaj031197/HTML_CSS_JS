    Read the entire problem description carefully to understand the necessary details.

The HTML code that is provided holds the following components and functions:
1. div#star-container => Containing 5 span.star inside it.
2. span.star => Individual star symbol with default grey color.
3. span#count => Containing the Rating Count, set as default number of '0'

You have to a JS program such that:
1. Whenever mouse hovers over any span.star:
1.1. All the stars till the target span.star, change color to yellow.
1.2. To do this you need to add class of 'star-filled' to stars that need to be yellow.
1.3. and remove the class of 'star-filled' from all the stars that need to be of default color. (grey)

2. Whenever any span.star is clicked on:
2.1. You need to repeat step 1 to color the stars yellow till the target span.star
2.2. Update the Rating Count (span#count) with the star points. (Ex: If third star is clicked, rating count becomes 3)
2.3. Store the value of star points globally, to update the colors when the mouse hovers over or leaves any span.star

3. Whenever mouse leaves any span.star after hover:
3.1. Remove the class of 'star-filled' from all the stars beyond the selected star points global value. (set to 0 by default)
